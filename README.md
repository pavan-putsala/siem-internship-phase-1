# siem-internship-phase-1

Welcome to the **SIEM Internship Phase-1** repository. This project is part of a hands-on cybersecurity internship focused on building a personal SOC (Security Operations Center) lab, simulating adversarial techniques, and detecting them using Splunk as the SIEM. Each use case is designed to introduce core concepts in log collection, parsing, threat detection, and alerting.

---

## 🎓 Internship Objective

* Set up a functional SIEM environment (Splunk Free edition)
* Collect logs from Windows machines via Universal Forwarder
* Simulate adversarial techniques
* Detect and alert on suspicious activity based on real-world attack patterns
* Document detection engineering tasks professionally

---

## 📚 Lab Architecture

* **Host Machine**: Running Splunk Web Interface
* **Windows 10 VM**: Target machine with Sysmon, Event Logs, and Splunk Universal Forwarder
* **Kali Linux VM**: Used for attack simulation using tools like `hydra` and `crackmapexec`

Logs from the Windows VM are shipped to the host Splunk instance using Splunk Universal Forwarder.

---

## 📊 Use Cases Implemented

### 1. Brute Force Login Detection

* **Technique**: Multiple failed login attempts followed by successful login
* **Event IDs**: 4625 (Failure), 4624 (Success)
* **Tools**: crackmapexec (Kali), Windows Security Logs
* **Goal**: Detect brute force attempts followed by a successful privileged login from the same IP within 5 minutes

### 2. Suspicious Logon Times

* **Technique**: Privileged login outside business hours
* **Event ID**: 4624
* **Logic**: Detect admin logins beyond 7 PM or before 9 AM

### 3. Lateral Movement via RDP

* **Technique**: RDP logins using valid credentials after failed attempts
* **Event ID**: 4624 (LogonType=10), 4625
* **Goal**: Detect lateral movement attempts and correlate with previous failures

### 4. Log Tampering Simulation

* **Technique**: Clearing Windows Event Logs using commands like `wevtutil cl`
* **Event IDs**: Sysmon 1 (Process Execution), 1102 (Security log cleared)
* **Goal**: Detect attempts to tamper or clear log files

### 5. Hidden User Account Creation

* **Technique**: Adding a new user to the Administrators group
* **Event IDs**: 4720 (Account Created), 4732 (User added to group)
* **Goal**: Detect creation of suspicious accounts and privilege escalation

## 🚀 Outcome

By completing this project, I learned:

* End-to-end log forwarding and detection engineering
* SPL query writing and alert creation in Splunk
* Threat simulation and mapping to MITRE ATT\&CK
